// Issue #717: when the player scrolls up on this page, the browser's own toolbar hides and the
// game layer (`page.tsx`'s `gameLayer` ref, `fixed inset-0`) grows to fill the extra visible
// height. Before this issue, only the enlarged card preview (`CardPreview.tsx`) used that extra
// room; the mission cards, the ship cards, the under-mission pile stack, and every pile-panel
// card grid stayed at a fixed pixel size, leaving the freed-up space blank.
//
// `useTableScale` turns the game layer's own live size into a single number, 1 at the baseline
// size those fixed pixel constants were tuned against, and larger once there's more room than
// that. Every constant this issue grows (`TableCard.tsx`'s `TABLE_CARD_WIDTH`/
// `TABLE_CARD_ART_HEIGHT`, `MissionRow.tsx`'s ship-row sizes, `PilePanel.tsx`'s card grid) is
// multiplied by this same scale, so they all grow in proportion to each other.
//
// A `ResizeObserver` on the game layer, the same pattern `CardSearchClient.tsx` already uses for
// a live element size, catches a toolbar hide/show; neither a `matchMedia` query nor a one-off
// `window.innerHeight` read fires for that.

// The 568x320 viewport the fixed pixel card sizes below were tuned against (see
// `MissionRow.tsx`'s `BADGE_STRIP_HEIGHT_BASE` comment) — scale 1 at this height, larger once the
// game layer measures taller than it.
const BASELINE_HEIGHT = 320; // px

// The space around the five mission columns that stays fixed regardless of scale: `page.tsx`'s
// own `p-4` padding on both sides of the game layer's content (32px), and `MissionRow.tsx`'s own
// `gap-2` between the five columns (8px, four gaps).
const CONTENT_PADDING = 32; // px, both sides combined
const MISSION_ROW_GAP = 8; // px

// Pure function, so the scale math can be tested with plain numbers rather than a real
// `ResizeObserver` (jsdom has none; `jest.setup.ts` stubs it out as a no-op).
//
// The scale is bounded by height (how much taller than the baseline the game layer measures) and
// by width (the five mission columns, at that scale, must still fit the available width) — the
// smaller of the two wins, since the freed-up space this issue targets is vertical, not
// horizontal: a wide-but-short viewport must not grow past what its width allows just because
// its height ratio alone would allow more. The result never drops below 1: a shorter-than-
// baseline game layer (the toolbar showing) keeps today's fixed sizes rather than shrinking them
// further.
